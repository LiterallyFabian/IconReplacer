# IconReplacer
The point of this program is to replace Dead by Daylight icons with the same image, making random perk challenges easier. It could be used for pretty much anything, though.

## Usage
1. Clone & open in a .NET environment, or grab the executables from GitHub.
2. Create a new directory called `input` in the same directory as the executable.
3. Run the program. All `*.png` paths in `input` will be copied to `output`, but with a new file.
